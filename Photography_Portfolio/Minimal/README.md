This is a later updated version using lessons learned from the first site. It was never used, or finalized, but attempted
to make both the site and the code a bit more clean.

This site intended to use matching QR coded cards. These cards would contain a URL to the site to load the image on that card
along with displaying contact information that was embedded on the card, not on the site. Keeping personal info only accessible to
a holder of the business card when using it online.
